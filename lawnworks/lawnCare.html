        </p>
        <h3>Aeration and Dethatching</h3>
        <p>
            This reduces the compaction of the surface and provides oxygen and vital nutrients to the soil. With the
            passage of time, patches of grass gather above the layer of soil and block the passage of air into the
            surface. This is called thatching.
            <br>
            <br>
            We provide specific dethatching and aeration services to reduce the thatch maintaining its required amount
            in the soil. Lawn fertilization and aeration is a great way to boost the health of your lawn and we help
            you maintain the green and healthy turf that you are looking for.

            <br>
            <br>
            We provide aeration services in the spring and fall. Aeration involves making holes in he lawn either by
            pushing a rod into it by "coring" , extracting a plug of soil. By aerating your lawn you provide the
            following benefits to your lawn and its root system.

            <br>
            <br>
            a) Oxygen gets to the roots and the soil allows it to "breath"
            <br>
            b) Organic fertilizers & nutrients get access to the root system.
            <br>
            c) Water is able to better soak the soil and reach the root system.
            <br>
            d) Helps break up thatch
            <br>
            e) Tight , compacted soil is loosened up allowing he root system to grow.
            <br>
            <br>
            De-thatching:
            <br>
            Over time,small pieces of grass die and gather just above the soil. This is called thatch.Small amounts of
            thatch can be beneficial. It's organic material that is broken down by microbes in the soil. But sometimes,
            thatch builds up too fast for natural processes to break it down. It forms a barrier, keeping moisture and
            air from going where your grass needs it. ½ an inch or more of thatch can weaken your lawn.
        </p>
        <h3>Overseeding and Sodding</h3>
        <p>
            Lawnworks also provides over-seeding and sodding services throughout the year
            <br>
            <br>
            Sodded lawns are easy to establish and provide a solid return on your landscaping investment. While the
            site preparation is similar for sodding or seeding an area, the maintenance required to establish healthy
            lawn is lower for sod.
        </p>
        <h3>Seed</h3>
        <p>
            Advantages of Seed:The initial cost of seeding a yard versus sodding is usually much less due to labour
            intensive costs. Certain varieties of seed can be chosen to best suit your lawns conditions. Extremely
            sunny or shady.
            <br>
            <br>
            Disadvantages of Seed: A seeded yard can often take 1-3 years depending on the soil and growing conditions
            before it can be compared to a newly sodded yard.If a lawn becomes eroded prior to becoming fully
            established, it may need to be totally redone.Seeded lawns are not uniform in height and color and can
            appear patchy until all areas properly fill in.
