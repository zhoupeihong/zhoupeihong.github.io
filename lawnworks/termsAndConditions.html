        <p>All of our products are hand made! If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. Our shop is small and
            we take great pride in the details. Our philosophy is if you treat ’em right you’ll be better off in the
            end.</p>
        <h2>PAYMENTS</h2>
        <p>We accept paypal for payments. Payment via paypal is expected within 48 hours. If we have not received your
            payment within 48 hours, and you have not made other arrangements with LawnWorks CT, we reserve the right
            to cancel the sale.</p>
        <h2>SHIPPING</h2>
        <p>In most cases, we ship via USPS Priority Mail. Our goal is to save you money on shipping and as a result we
            reserve the right to group items together in the most economical way we see fit. We would hope our products
            would be in your fingertips within approx 5-10 days. We do offer expedited shipping options in some cases.
            Please contact us directly at info@lawnworksct.com to discuss these options prior to items shipping.</p>
        <h2>REFUNDS AND EXCHANGES</h2>
        <p>Due to the personal nature of our products, we cannot accept any returns except in cases of damage during
            shipping or in the rare case that the wrong item was sent. If either of these happen, please contact us
            within 48 hours of receiving your package so we can file the appropriate claims. Please do not return any
            products to us without prior notification. Please do not dispose of any of the original packaging as this
            may be needed to file the appropriate claims.</p>
