        <h2>Tree Removal</h2>
        <p>Tree removal is a highly technical, yet delicate, task and requires highly qualified professionals, like
            those at Lawnworks. Tree removals address health, liability, and aesthetics and enable competing species to
            develop and mature. In certain instances, you may have to remove a tree that is alive if it is interfering
            with other trees, buildings, driveways, or utilities. We are able to remove large, full size trees that are
            close to, or hanging over, houses, garages, high wires, yard sheds, playgrounds, and other obstacles.</p>
