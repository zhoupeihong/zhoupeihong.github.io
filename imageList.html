        <p>The Game of Life was invented in 1970 by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. Conway developed an
            interest in a problem which was made evident in the 1940’s by mathematician John von Neumann, who aimed to
            find
            a hypothetical machine that had the ability to create copies of itself and was successful when he
            discovered a
            mathematical model for such a machine with very complicated rules on a rectangular grid. Thus, the Game of
            Life
            was Conway’s way of simplifying von Neumann’s ideas. It is the best-known example of a cellular automaton
            which
            is any system in which rules are applied to cells and their neighbors in a regular grid. Martin Gardner
            popularized the Game of Life by writing two articles for his column “Mathematical Games” in the journal
            Scientific American in 1970 and 1971.</p>
